##Blocks

Blocks aka Compound Statements

* **let** and **const** are block scope
* **var** is function scoped


## Shadowing

Shadowing happens when a local variable with a specific scope has same name as a variable in oute scope , thereby hiding the outer variable

This is achieved using let/const variable

```
let a= 100;
{
  let a = 10;
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);

```

**OUTPUT**
10
100

---

```
var a= 100;
{
  let a = 10;
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);

// Here they both are in separate memory spaces.

```

**OUTPUT**
10
100

---

```
let a = 10;
{
  let a = 20;
  {
    let a = 30;
    {
      let a = 40;
      console.log(a);
    }
  }
}

console.log(a);
// Here 4 different memory block would be created 
// each with a separate value of a, and proper Lexical 
// scope chain would be followed
```

**OUTPUT**
40
10

---

```
let a = 10;
{
  let a = 20;
  {
    let a = 30;
    {
      let a = 40;
    }
  }
  console.log(a);
}

console.log(a);

// Here 4 different memory block would be created 
// each with a separate value of a, and proper Lexical 
// scope chain would be followed
```

**OUTPUT**
20
10

#Illegal Shadowing

This happens when a variable declared in a certain scope is shadowed by a variable of same name using a different type of variabe declaration.

```

let a=10;
{
  var a=20;  // this is var-> Global scope
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);

//this will throw a syntax error 
SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
```
