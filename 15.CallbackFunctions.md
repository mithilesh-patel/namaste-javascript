Garbage collection and why do we remove event listeners

EL is heavy along with the lexical scope. 


```javascript

setTimeout(function show(params) {
  console.log("This is show"+ params);
},4000)

function x(y) {
  console.log("x");
  y();
}

x(function another() {
  console.log('another');
});
```

here we are calling x with a callback function as defined in line number 14.


#### Why do we need to remove Event Listener

Because it is heavy along with all the lexical scope. even when we are not calling/hitting the event , the program cannot free up the logic of the function, because we never know when the event will be called , so we cannot leave them,

So a good practice is to free up the event listeners, then all the variables which was held by the EL will be garbage collected.


### First class func VS Call back function

The distinction between a callback function and a first-class function lies in their roles and how they are used within a programming language like JavaScript.

**First-Class Function:**

- A first-class function is a concept in programming languages where functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be:
  - Assigned to variables
  - Passed as arguments to other functions
  - Returned from other functions
  
- In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, so they can be used like any other value or data type.

**Callback Function:**

- A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some event or operation.
- Callback functions are often used to handle asynchronous operations, such as when data is received from a server or when a user clicks a button.
- In JavaScript, callback functions are commonly used with functions that perform asynchronous operations, such as setTimeout, event handlers, and AJAX requests.


In summary, **a callback function is a specific use case of a first-class function**. *All callback functions are first-class functions because they can be passed around like any other value, but not all first-class functions are necessarily used as callbacks*.

**Call back function is a subset of First Class functions**
