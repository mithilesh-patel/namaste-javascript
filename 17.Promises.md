```javascript


  const GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com/users/mithilesh-patel";

  const user = fetch(GITHUB_API)
  .then((xyz) => console.log(xyz), (rejected)=> console.log(rejected))




```

# Promises
Here the the fetch function returns and API response and we are expectiong it at later time.
The .then() method takes up to two arguments; the first argument is a callback function for the fulfilled case of the promise, and the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case. Each .then() returns a newly generated promise object, which can optionally be used for chaining; for example:



```javascript

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("foo");
  }, 300);
});

myPromise
  .then(handleFulfilledA, handleRejectedA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB, handleRejectedB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC, handleRejectedC);

```
