// ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous function, which is known as Arrow Functions.
// In an Arrow function, everything remains the same, except here we don’t need the function keyword also.
// Here, we define the function by a single parenthesis and then ‘=>’ followed by the function body.

var sayHello = () => {console.log("Hello")}

sayHello();
